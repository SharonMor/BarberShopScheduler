## :barber: Architecture Project

This project is a **web-based application** designed to streamline the process of **scheduling appointments for hairdressers**. It serves as a practical implementation of **Software as a Service (SAAS)** and **Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)** principles. 

In addition to these, I've also incorporated some basic design patterns such as the **Adapter** and **Singleton** to further enhance the project's efficiency and robustness.
